## Soundcloud Redesign Concept
I was thinking about to try React.js library with Flux Application Architecture for a while. And the best way to learn is to make something, so I decided to make very basic music app. I use Soundcloud very often and its design fills a bit complicated, so I was looking for a more simple way of listening to music.
I found on Behance [redesign concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25823627/Simpler-Soundcloud-Redesign-Concept) and implemented it(not fully) on React and Flux.
Thanks to [Amr Zakaria](https://www.behance.net/AmrZakaria) for an idea!
