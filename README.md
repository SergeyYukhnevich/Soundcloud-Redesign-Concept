## Soundcloud Redesign Concept
I was thinking about to try React.js library with Flux Application Architecture for a while. And the best way to learn is to make something, so I decided to make very basic music app. I use Soundcloud very often and its design fills a bit complicated, so I was looking for a more simple way of listening to music.
I found on Behance [redesign concept](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25823627/Simpler-Soundcloud-Redesign-Concept) and implemented it(not fully)  in React.
Thanks to [Amr Zakaria](https://www.behance.net/AmrZakaria) for an idea!

## Technical side
This app was written in ES6, React and Flux.

## How to get working

```sh
npm install marky-markdown --save
```
If you wanna use http-server for serving files or skip the next step either
```sh
npm install http-server
```

```sh
gulp
```

```sh
gulp
```

```sh
